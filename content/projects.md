Votr is a clean and intuitive way to follow how elected representatives vote in parliament.

The app breaks down complex motions, proposals, and voting results into an easy-to-understand format, letting you stay informed without digging through heavy documents.

Create your own profile, cast your own votes, and see how your opinions compare with other users. You can also explore how parties and individual members vote over time, helping you understand what your politicians actually do—not just what they say.

Future updates will introduce social features and the ability to follow specific politicians' work in more detail.

Votr makes political transparency accessible, engaging, and personal.

**Status:** Currently under development
